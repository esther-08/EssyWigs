# Project Scope

## Project name
       EssyWigs

## Project scope statement

This project is aimed at building a hair wigs and extensions ASP.NET web application using MVC. The e-shop will provide a digital solution to improve accessibility of hair extension products in Sweden.

## Background

There is an observable gap in accessibility of women hair extensions and wigs in Sweden. Due to the exponential
population increase of the African community in Sweden, digital solutions that improve wellbeing by bringing such basic needs closer to the stated market 
segment are on high demand. Acording to a survey conducted through the use of the google search engine, a search for hair extensions and wigs returns links to websites for online shops 
outside Sweden. EssyWigs is a solution that doesn't only improve assecibility but in addition, inherently reduces costs incurred and waiting time when the alternatives are considered.

## Deliverables

- The website displays a webpage with available products, their images and a shopping cart.
- Each product has the following properties;
    - Length
